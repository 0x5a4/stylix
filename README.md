# Stylix

Stylix is a NixOS module which applies the same color scheme, font and
wallpaper to a wide range of applications and desktop environments. It also
exports utilities for you to use the theme in custom parts of your configuration.

Stylix is built upon [base16.nix](https://github.com/SenchoPens/base16.nix#readme),
a library which processes themes created for
[base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16#readme) or
[Tinted Theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming).
